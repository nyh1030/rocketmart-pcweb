# CHANGELOG

## Version 12

####Â 12.3.0

Callbacks now pass more arguments!

`callback_enter`, `callback_exit` now pass:
1. the DOM element that entered / exited the viewport
2. the `IntersectionObserverEntry` that triggered the enter/exit event
3. the LazyLoad instance

`callback_load`, `callback_error`, `callback_reveal` now pass
1. the DOM element that entered / exited the viewport
2. the LazyLoad instance

`callback_finish` now passes:
1. the LazyLoad instance

The README file has been updated accordingly.

#### 12.2.0

Released new feature "retry when back online". Now if your users lose the internet connection causing errors on images loading, this script tries and loads those images again when the connection is restored.

#### 12.1.1

Solved a bug with Internet Explorer 11 and the W3C polyfill, as reported in #383.

#### 12.1.0

- Updated npm dev dependencies
- Added the new `image_ph_inline.html`, with an inline SVG placeholder
- Added the new `image_ph_external.html`, with an external SVG placeholder
 
#### 12.0.3

Updated the IntersectionObserver polyfill to version 0.7.0

#### 12.0.2

Improved detection of browser support of IntersectionObserver, as suggested in #362. Thanks to @kaldonir

#### 12.0.1

Updated CHANGELOG.md and README.md to mention the change of the option name `callback_load` which is called `callback_loaded` in versions 11.0.0 and above.

#### 12.0.0 

- Reorganized code
- Improved native lazy loading demos
- Aligned console messages throughout all demos.

#### 12.0.0-beta.0

- Added the `use_native` option which enables *native lazy loading* (where supported) with the `loading="lazy"` attribute. See #331
- Added two demos:
  - native_lazyload_conditional.html which you can use to test the `use_native` option
  - native_lazyload.html which always uses native lazy loading (without JS) just to test how it works beyond the LazyLoad script
- Refactored the constructor and the `update` method

## Version 11

#### 11.0.6

Restored the `callback_set` callback as **deprecated**, in order to make the upgrade from v.10 easier.

#### 11.0.5

Fixed the `module` property of this package.json, which was pointing to a non-existing dist file.

#### 11.0.4

Fixed the `main` property of this package.json, which was pointing to a non-existing dist file.

#### 11.0.3

Rollback of the patch applied in 11.0.2 since it gave strange results in some cases. See #293. Thanks to @davejamesmiller for the analysis and the report.

#### 11.0.2

Applied a patch to resolve #293 a [Chromium bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=910741#c13) already fixed in Chrome 72. Thanks to @dverbovyi for the analysis and the report.

#### 11.0.1

Squashed a nasty bug that occurred on IE 11 and Safari when the `IntersectionObserver` polyfill wasn't loaded before LazyLoad.

#### 11.0.0

- Changed bundle file name of ES Module from `lazyload.es2015.js` to `lazyload.esm.js`
- Removed the `to_webp` option (see issue #288)
- Ceased support and development of LazyLoad v.8 (see issue #306)
version. If you were using it, please update your code to use `callback_reveal` instead.
- Private methods like `_setObserver`, `_onIntersection` etc. are now hidden from the outside.
- Added the `auto_unobserve` boolean option, see API.
- Bugfix: `loadAll()` didn't unobserve elements.
- Updated to Jest 24, Babel 7, etc.
- Fixed dev dependencies vulnerabilities
- Updated callbacks. See below:

Callbacks updated:

- **Changed** `callback_enter`. This callback is now called whenever an element enters the viewport, even when `load_delay` is set. In previous versions, this callback was delayed until an element started loading if a `load_delay` was set. Note that this is a **possible breaking change**, which you can fix using `callback_reveal` instead.
- **Renamed** `callback_loaded` is the new name of `callback_load`.
- **Added** `callback_exit`. This callback is called whenever an element exits the viewport, even if a `load_delay` is set.
- **Added** `callback_reveal`. This callback is called just after an element starts loading.
- **Deprecated** `callback_set`. This callback still works*, but will be removed in the next major 

\* it didn't work from versions 11.0.0 to 11.0.5, it still works from 11.0.6.

## Version 10

#### 10.20.1

Fixed a bug for which LazyLoad didn't copy the `data-sizes` attribute value to `sizes` in `source` tags inside `picture`. See #307.

#### 10.20.0

**BUGFIX**: Class `loaded` was not applied to a loaded video (issue #239).

**BUGFIX**: Autoplaying video not loaded correctly after entering the viewport (issue #240). Thanks to @maeligg.

#### 10.16.0

Added new option `load_delay` to skip loading when fast scrolling occurs, as requested in issues #235 and #166.

| Filename               | Module Type                                    | Advantages                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `lazyload.min.js`      | UMD (Universal Module Definition)              | Works pretty much everywhere, even in common-js contexts           |
| `lazyload.iife.min.js` | IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) | Works as in-page `<script src="">`, ~0.5kb smaller minified        |
| `lazyload.amd.min.js`  | AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition)           | Works with the *require.js* module loader, ~0.5kb smaller minified |
| `lazyload.es2015.js`   | ES Module type                                 | Exports `LazyLoad` so you can import it in your project            |

#### 10.12.0

SEO! Expanded SEO-friendliness to more crawlers, Bingbot included.

#### 10.11.1

**BUGFIX**: Fixed issue #225. Due to mistyped BOT detection, in version 10.11.0 all images were loaded as soon as `LazyLoad` was created.

#### 10.11.0

SEO! Version 10.x is now as SEO-friendly as version 8.x.

#### 10.10.0

Added a public `load` method to force loading any element.

#### 10.9.0

Added the ability to lazily set the `sizes` attribute via a `data-sizes` attribute.
See the [README](README.md) file for more information.

#### 10.8.0

Added a public `loadAll` method to force loading all the images, as asked in #193.

#### 10.7.0

- Added support for the `<video>` HTML tag and descending `<source>` tags. 
  Now you can lazily load your videos too!
- Created the `video.html` demo.

#### 10.5.1

Just a refactoring over previous version.

#### 10.5.0

Added node support by merging pull request #188, "node-support" by @klarstrup.

With these changes in place, simply importing vanilla-lazyload without using it won't crash Node by itself. This is important for isomorphic/universal/server rendered setups where the same code runs on both the server and the browser.

#### 10.4.2

Fixed a bug for which sometimes images wouldn't reveal on Chrome 65 (see issue #165).

#### 10.4.1

Updated `dist` folder.

#### 10.3.0

Restored support to IE9 and IE10, as requested in #118 and #132.

#### 10.2.0

To solve cases when you can't select the elements to load using a string, added the ability to pass a `NodeList` object...

- as a second parameter in the constructor, after the regular option object, e.g. `var ll = new Lazyload({}, myNodeList)`
- as a single parameter to the `update()` method, e.g. `ll.update(myNodeList)`

#### 10.1.0

To solve cases when you can't select the elements to load using a string, added the ability to pass a `NodeList` object to the `elements_selector` option, as suggested by @SassNinja in #130.

#### 10.0.1

Solved a problem with cdnjs.com: version 10.0.0 was pointing to 9.0.0.
